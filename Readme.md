These are sample codes for extracting data from https://data.gov.sg. As a test case, we try to extract 
the Domestic Exports by Area data (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/domestic-exports-by-area).

I provide two ways to extract:
1. Use Jupyter Notebook (I tested on Google Colab). You can find it in the .ipynb file in this repo.
2. Use Power Query in Microsoft Excel. I put the Power Query code in the .txt file in this repo. To generate this, you can follow the steps at: https://marcusrauhut.com/importing-json-data-into-excel-power-query/
