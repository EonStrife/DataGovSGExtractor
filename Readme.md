These are sample codes for extracting data from https://data.gov.sg. As a test case, I try to extract 
the Domestic Exports by Area data (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/domestic-exports-by-area).

I provide two ways to extract:
1. Use Jupyter Notebook (I tested on Google Colab). You can find it in the .ipynb file in this repo.
2. Use Power Query in Microsoft Excel. I put the Power Query source code in the .txt file in this repo. I generated this by doing steps based on the instruction in this page: https://marcusrauhut.com/importing-json-data-into-excel-power-query/. I also attach .xlsx file to show the data I have pulled into my MS Excel file.
